Recovery - recovery is used when performance matters a lot.

Prevention - when stability and safety are the priority instead of performance. We can negate one of the four required deadlock conditions.

Avoidance - deadlocks can be avoided, but only if is known in advance that the system is able to decide whether granting a resource is safe or not and make the allocation only when it is safe. It is useful when deadlocks are unlikeable but performance is important too.
