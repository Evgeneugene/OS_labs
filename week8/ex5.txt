Physical memory is the actual RAM and stores the currently executing programs, the data itself. Virtual memory is an abstraction, logical technique for memory management that allows to create an illusion that there is more physical memory and to execute larger programs. It is enabled by transferring pages of data from RAM to disk storage.
